For project 3 I chose to do one of the first games I ever played, snake. Snake is a very simple game where you try to get as long a 
tail as possible by eating mice that randomly spawn in the map. The ways to die (in this simple version) are by running into a wall or running into your own tail (which increases by one unit whenever a mouse is eaten).

Features: sounds for when a mouse is eaten and for when you die, on screen click on right half will turn snake right (and on screen click on left half will turn snake left). scoreboard, working on adding high score and adjustable mice spawn. Other than that fairly simple project. Credit to this site: http://androidgameprogramming.com/programming-a-snake-game/ for getting me started.
